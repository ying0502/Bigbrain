ReactJS: BigBrain

## 1. Background & Motivation

*An innovative lightweight quiz platform for millenials* We called this quiz application **BigBrain**.

## 2. The Front-end

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run `yarn install` to install all of the dependencies necessary to run the ReactJS app. Then run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the ReactJS app.

A series of features below need to be implemented in your ReactJS app to operate in conjunction with the backend


## 3. The Back-end

The backend server exists in your individual repository. After you clone this repo, you must run `npm install` in the project directory once.

To run the backend server, simply run `npm run backend` in the project directory. This will start the backend.

The backend is persistent in terms of data storage. That means the data will remain even after your express server process stops running. If you want to reset the data in the backend, you can run `npm run reset`.
